                I started designing at 13. Living in a rural area with a limited
                internet connection, I lugged our family’s iMac to a friend’s
                house to download a (totally legal) copy of adobe illustrator.{" "}
                <br />
                <br />
                I’ve approached my career since then with a similar amount of
                vigour. Always seeking to learn, understand, and evolve. I find
                joy in the process of piecing together small parts of the built
                world. Guided by the hope that my work can help to create
                products that are subservient to the individual, systems that
                empower human agency, and experiences that foster understanding.

                When I’m not designing, you can find me obsessively reading,
                spreadsheeting, or annoying my wife about my obsession of the
                month. Past episodes have included: optimization of
                tax-advantage investment accounts, the perfect t-shirt,
                correcting my broken body due to 10+ years of sitting at a
                computer, & much more. Feel free to ask and I’ll fill you into
                the featured selection. <br />

                I’m currently based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The city I went
                to college, met my wife, and a place that seems to consistently
                pull me back.
