                Wayfair partnered with TTF at the end of 2018. We were tasked
                with embedding our team inside Wayfair to help revitalize &
                redesign aspects of Partner Home, the system they provide to
                fulfillment partners. Over the years, this system had drifted
                further and further away from the real needs of users, and as
                the company scaled, the friction became measurable.

                The disconnect between user needs and the provided tools
                materialized in direct impact on the efficiency, and bottom
                line, of the business. We were tasked with a ground-up redesign
                of their order management system. But to deliver on this goal,
                we needed to develop a deep understanding of their partner's
                day-to-day processes, environments, and bottlenecks. We would
                then use those learnings to help inform a system designed to
                help partners be successful.

                Working on a complicated enterprise tool as an outside
                consultant isn’t for the faint of heart. No interface alone can
                solve experience problems that extend far outside the realm of
                digital interaction. A system with dependencies intertwined
                across the organization — this was an exercise of untangling
                business processes, socializing design decisions, and creating a
                shared language of understanding.

                As UX Design Lead, my responsibilities were critical to the
                success of the project. I conducted on-site & remote research
                sessions, created alignment across many product teams via
                research reports, documented & helped evolve the internal
                processes behind the interface, and designed and led development
                of interface prototypes.

                Visited dozens of partners across the US & the UK to conduct
                on-site contextual research sessions. This allowed us to create
                a comprehensive picture of their working environment, internal
                processes, and more personally understand the humans that
                interact with the system on a daily basis.
