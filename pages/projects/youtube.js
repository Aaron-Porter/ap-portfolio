                YouTube is the center of the universe for video on the internet.
                But it’s optimized for one-off, medium length content. So when
                we began investing heavily in original episodic & long-form
                programming, the need to design for this experience became
                apparent.

                Our hypothesis was that premium content deserved a catered,
                premium experience. So we dove into understanding exactly what
                where the journeys around this type of content and we
                researched, designed, and prototyped our way to some new
                solutions.

                Working inside of a large institution with a rich legacy of UX
                patterns is challenging enough, but when you purposelly seek to
                break those patterns to solve for a new use-case, you must move
                slowly & works in sync with every stakeholder.

                As a User Experience Designer at Google, I was an Interaction
                Designer for all of the Premium Original Content surfaces across
                YouTube. I was responsible for identifying opportunities,
                designing solutions, and working with the broader team to bring
                them to fruition.

                  I identified a gap in our asset creation workflow that created
                  friction & excessive manual labor. So I built an internal tool
                  to automate portions of the process. Giving autonomy to our
                  counterparts.
