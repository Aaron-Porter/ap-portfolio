                YouTube is the center of the universe for video on the internet.
                But from the beginning, its been optimized for one-off medium
                length content. So when we began investing heavily in original
                episodic & long-form programming, we needed to intentionally
                design for the experience of consuming that type of content.

                Our hypothesis was that premium content deserved to be
                encompanied by a premium experience. And by creating a distinct
                experience for our subscribers, we could make our offering more
                desirable & useful.

                Working inside of a large institution with a rich legacy of UX
                patterns is challenging enough, but when you purposelly seek to
                break those patterns to solve for a new use-case, you must move
                slowly & ensure you works in-sync with every stakeholder.

                YouTube. I was responsible for identifying opportunities,

                Worked with our research team to define critical user journeys
                for our product area. Product decisions were then measured by
                their impact against these journeys — giving design & research
                metrics by which to enact change.

                Identified a gap in our asset creation workflow that created
                friction & excessive manual labor. So I built an internal tool

                counterparts.
