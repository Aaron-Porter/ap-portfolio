                An estimated 45 million Americans are financial caregivers —
                adult children responsible for the financial well-being of their
                aging parents. They pay bills, haggle with utilities, plan for
                their future, and pay for things they need — all while managing
                their own financial and family life.

                Confusing forms, unsustainable spending behavior, inscrutable
                legal processes, fraud, abuse — caregivers face a broad set of
                issues, only compounded by the emotional complexity of a
                shifting power dynamic in their parental relationship.

                I joined Carefull at the very beginning of its life (employee
                2). Velocity was the life-blood of the business, we needed
                high-conviction design artifacts produced every single day. Our
                mantra was to understand quickly, ship needed functionality, and
                iterate relentlessly.
